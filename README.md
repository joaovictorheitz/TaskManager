# 📝 Task Manager App
Welcome to the Task Manager App repository! This is a simple task management application developed using SwiftUI, SwiftData, and Tuist for project configuration. The goal of this project is to serve as a study and practice tool.

## 📖 Overview
The Task Manager App allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks easily and intuitively. The app layout was inspired by a design found in the Figma Community.

## ✨ Features
Add new tasks

Conclude tasks

User-friendly and intuitive interface
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### 🖥️ SwiftUI
We used SwiftUI for building the user interface, taking advantage of its declarative syntax and its ability to create reactive and modern interfaces.

### 🗃️ SwiftData
SwiftData was used for data management, providing easy integration with SwiftUI and simplifying persistent data handling.

### 🔧 Tuist
Tuist was used for project configuration. Some advantages of Tuist include:

Simplifies the generation and maintenance of Xcode project files.
Eases project modularization.
Improves consistency and reproducibility of the development environment.
## 🎨 Layout
The app layout was based on a design found in the Figma Community. You can check out the original design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/iVoIn3irSYBLJGekIkUnYR/TODO-App-(Community)?m=auto&t=7bTLdnA9GMn3dnDB-1).
